# Atlas OS Operator Runbook

## Generate a GreenRock Report

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/atlas-os
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
atlas greenrock report-draft
```

The report is written to:

```text
.atlas/output/greenrock/<run_id>/greenrock_report_draft.md
```

The workflow uses mock data only and creates a pending approval record.

## Inspect Candidates

```bash
atlas greenrock latest-candidates
atlas greenrock review
```

Use `latest-candidates` for a quick large-cap and small/mid-cap summary. Use `review` for latest run status, report path, approval status, and top candidate names.

## Open Latest Report

```bash
atlas greenrock latest-report
atlas greenrock open-latest
```

On macOS, `open-latest` opens the Markdown report file. On unsupported systems, Atlas prints the report path.

## Review Approval Queue

```bash
atlas approvals pending
atlas approvals latest
atlas approvals show <approval_id>
```

Report drafts remain blocked while pending or rejected.

## Approve or Reject

```bash
atlas approvals approve <approval_id>
atlas approvals reject <approval_id>
```

Only approve after human review. Approval updates the linked workflow run and report status.

## Export Approved PDF

PDF export is blocked until the linked approval is approved.

```bash
atlas approvals approve <approval_id>
atlas greenrock export-pdf <approval_id>
```

The approved PDF is saved to the same run folder as the Markdown report:

```text
.atlas/output/greenrock/<run_id>/greenrock_report_final.pdf
```

The export creates a `report_final_pdf` artifact record. Do not export pending or rejected reports for client-facing use.

## Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the Atlas OS change"
git push
```

Review generated files before committing. Local databases, output reports, logs, and temporary files should stay ignored.

## Safety Reminders

- Use mock data only until live integrations are explicitly approved.
- Do not access client files, credentials, OneDrive, Gmail, IBKR, or external APIs.
- Do not send email or distribute reports from Atlas OS.
- Do not treat mock output as investment advice.
- No client-facing report may be published without explicit human approval.
